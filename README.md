Iris Flower Classification Model

This repository contains a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. The dataset used for this project is from the popular [Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/drisrarahmad/iris-flower-dataset/input) on Kaggle.

Dataset

The dataset consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 4 features for each sample:

- **Sepal Length**: Length of the sepal (cm)
- **Sepal Width**: Width of the sepal (cm)
- **Petal Length**: Length of the petal (cm)
- **Petal Width**: Width of the petal (cm)

The target variable is the **species** of the flower, which has 3 classes:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `matplotlib`: For visualizing the data and results.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and handling CSV files.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and tools.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
